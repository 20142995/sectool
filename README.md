|2023-11-07 07:03:52|[pdfparser](https://github.com/smalot/pdfparser)|Major Update to PDFObject.php + Ancillary (#634)  *<br> Rewrite PDFObject.php + ancillary    This is a majo<br>r update to the PHPObject.php file. Where previously<br> PdfParser would attempt to gather document stream d<br>ata using a series of multiline regular expressions,<br> this update changes the behaviour of cleanContent()<br> to the following:  - Hide all (strings)  - Remove a<br>ll newlines and carriage-returns  - Hide all >  - No<br>rmalize all whitespace  - Using a list of valid Oper<br>ators from the PDF Reference, add \r\n back to the r<br>emaining text so that there is a single PDF command <br>on every line  - Restore the > and (strings)    By u<br>sing this system, it is then much easier to examine <br>and parse the document stream in a line-by-line mann<br>er, instead of PREG extraction. getSections() text h<br>as been updated to do just this, stepping through th<br>e output of cleanContent() line-by-line and returnin<br>g an array of only the relevant commands needed to p<br>osition and display text.    The guts of getText() h<br>ave been moved to getTextArray() to reduce code dupl<br>ication. getTextArray() now takes into account both <br>the current graphics position cm and the scaling fac<br>tors of the text matrix Tm when adding \n and \t whi<br>tespace for positioning. Positioning is only taken i<br>nto account at the point of inserting text, rather t<br>han whenever a Tm or Td/TD was found.    It also tre<br>ats Q and q as a stack of stored states rather than <br>a single stored state.    The presence of ActualText<br> BDC commands is also taken into account and the con<br>tents of the ActualText will replace the formerly ou<br>tput text in both content and position. This require<br>s the new parseDictionary() method to reliably extra<br>ct such commands as well as any others PdfParser may<br> take into account in the future.    decodeText() in<br> **Font.php** now takes into account the current tex<br>t matrix when considering whether or not to add spac<br>es between words. Instead of implode()-ing the resul<br>t array with a space joiner, rely on the positioning<br> check to add all required spacing.    In decodeCont<br>ent() in **Font.php** add a check to see if the stri<br>ng to decode has the UTF-16BE BOM and decode it dire<br>ctly as Unicode if so.    * Add test, check for text<br>/plain    Add a unit test for correctly decoding an <br>emdash in Cyrillic text. Use sample PDF from issue h<br>ttps://github.com/smalot/pdfparser/issues/585 User @<br>se-ti allowed use of this file in issue https://gith<br>ub.com/smalot/pdfparser/issues/586#issuecomment-1634<br>361636    In cleanContent() once all strings and dic<br>tionaries are hidden, do a MIME-type check on the re<br>maining content. If it doesn't register as text/plai<br>n, then return an empty string. This prevents non-do<br>cument-stream data from being passed to cleanContent<br>() such as JPEG data in file '12249.pdf' from https:<br>//github.com/smalot/pdfparser/issues/458    Remove w<br>hitespace-adding code from **Font.php**. I originall<br>y added this code as a "shim" because decodeText() d<br>id not take into account the current Text Matrix whe<br>n considering what counted as "words". Now that it d<br>oes, the previous code of just implode()-ing with a <br>space character works.    * Modify some code comment<br>s + q and Q update    Modify several code comments t<br>o be clearer.    Remove the $key =>  from decodeText<br>() in **Font.php** as it's no longer needed.    Also<br>, now that cleanContent() is ignoring non text/plain<br> content, there should be no errant q or Q commands <br>that cause the stored-state stack to try restoring a<br> state that doesn't exist. Remove the kludgy code th<br>at prevented this.    * Update Font.php    Remove un<br>necessary $whitespace line.    * PHP-cs-fixer edits <br>   * Address some reviewed changes    * Use text mat<br>rix 'i' instead of 'b'    The correct matrix element<br>s to use for scaling the x-axis are actually the fir<br>st *column*, so 'a' and 'i', not 'a' and 'b'. My bad<br>! It worked before because almost always the x-axis <br>scaling is equal to the y-axis scaling.    * Use mb_<br>detect_encoding() instead of finfo()    The Fileinfo<br> functions are not installed by default on Windows, <br>so use a different method to determine whether the s<br>tream is valid or binary.    * Update Font.php    PH<br>P CS Fixer native_function_invocation    * Sort swit<br>ch statement cases in getTextArray()    Make the cas<br>es a little bit more alphabetical. Remove cases/comm<br>ands that aren't relevant to getting and positioning<br> text.    * Edit documentation comments, add tests  <br>  Add some documentation comment text to PDFObject.p<br>hp and fix a comment typo in Font.php.    Add a test<br> accounting for text-matrix scaling in Font::decodeT<br>ext().    Add a test verifying that a string prefixe<br>d by a UTF-16BE BOM is decoded directly by Font::dec<br>odeContent().    Move "ET in font name" test from te<br>stCleanContent() to testGetSectionsText() as that is<br> the function the test uses.    Add a test that veri<br>fies cleanContent() returns an empty string for bina<br>ry content.    Remove unnecessary variable reset fro<br>m ET command in Page::getDataTm. Only needed under B<br>T.    * Update ParserTest.php    Add a fixed numeric<br>al value instead of a multiple of $baselineMemory so<br> there's less dependence on the initial memory value<br> and more focus on how much memory the loading of th<br>e PDF actually takes. Hopefully fixes the last unit-<br>test failure?    Change tests to assertGreaterThan a<br>nd assertLessThan so it provides better failure info<br> than just assertTrue (will tell us the values).    <br>In my PHP 8.2.7 test env, the $usedMemory exceeds $b<br>aselineMemory by ~209,000,000 bytes at this point (l<br>ine 379). 180,000,000 should be safe?    * Restore o<br>riginal cleanContent()    Rename the new function fo<br>rmatContent() and restore the original cleanContent(<br>) function and tests. If anyone relied on these func<br>tions before then this will not be a backwards incom<br>patible change.    * added a few PDFs generated with<br> various tools to check conformance    * fixed CS is<br>sue    * Remove textMatrix from decodeText()    As i<br>t turns out, the current text matrix *can* be used t<br>o position text in decodeText(), but it is actually <br>applied **both** to the $offset and the user-selecte<br>d font space limit. In this way it cancels out, and <br>importing the text matrix into the function is not n<br>ecessary. Remove two tests in FontTest.php that were<br> associated with this, as they're no longer valid.  <br>  In decodeText() account for strings of text that h<br>ave spaces with large offsets, such as  'a    line  <br>  of    text    that    is    full-width    justifie<br>d.'  Treat these as single spaces instead of honouri<br>ng the offsets given and spacing them out unnecessar<br>ily.    Save and use the current font-size when gues<br>sing the "fudge" factor for text block width. Make s<br>ure this is saved as well when the q command is seen<br>.    Adjust the position factor threshold up from 10<br> to 24 for deciding when to insert tabs or spaces.  <br>  Also update the current horizontal position when s<br>toring the last-written-position for use by an Actua<br>lText.    Add a test for Microsoft Print-to-PDF v1.7<br>.    This change actually reverts the output value i<br>n a ParserTest assertion back to the original value <br>before this PR. So that's good!    * Account for tex<br>t leading, font-size factor    Keep track of, and ac<br>count for, the current text leading (space between l<br>ines) value when determining whether or not to inser<br>t newlines \n.    Use the current font size as a fac<br>tor in determining whether or not to insert position<br>ing whitespace.    Take more care wrt adding whitesp<br>ace. Examine some points where whitespace might be a<br>dded, and remove it if it's unnecessary. Implode wor<br>ds in Font.php, but examine the words to see if they<br> already have space characters on their fronts and e<br>nds.    TD and Td "move to the start of the next lin<br>e" so use a $current_position_td['x'] of zero (0) to<br> start with. This change shouldn't really affect muc<br>h since enough of a y-axis leading should be added t<br>hat a newline \n results.    In Integration\FontTest<br>.php remove "group linux-only" from testDecodeTextFo<br>rFontWithIndirectEncodingWithoutTypeEncoding() as th<br>is now succeeds in any environment. Before where Pdf<br>Parser was adding spaces after the "zůstatek:" lines<br> whereas now PdfParser adds tabs, which makes far mo<br>re sense when looking at the document /samples/bugs/<br>PullRequest500.pdf So change the expected results to<br> match the output.    * Update FontTest.php    Don't<br> use HEREDOC syntax to compose the expected value fo<br>r the testDecodeTextForFontWithIndirectEncodingWitho<br>utTypeEncoding() test in FontTest.php. This should a<br>llow it to work regardless of the PHP file line-endi<br>ngs.    * Misc fixes    - When assigning $current_te<br>xt_leading, take the negative as described in the PD<br>F Reference. Initialize it to zero, also as in the R<br>eference.  - Add back $current_position_td['x'] when<br> considering a Td or TD command as this appears to b<br>e the way it's supposed to be handled according to t<br>he reference.  - Add another check to remove unneces<br>sary whitespace by examining the previous string of <br>text for a trailing space.  - $current_position_tm['<br>x'] and $current_position_tm['y'] aren't tested for <br>an initial false value, so initialize them to 0.  - <br>Use double null bytes to implode the string in Font.<br>php to avoid catching UTF-8 bytes that might include<br> a single null byte.  - Base the text-box width gues<br>s on the current font size instead of a constant val<br>ue of 4.    - In PageTest.php, PdfParser now correct<br>ly inserts a newline between Aardappelen and Zak, so<br> change the test.  - In ParserTest.php, we are now r<br>emoving unnecessary whitespace, including double spa<br>ces, so change this test to match the output. (Doubl<br>e spaces changed to single spaces)    * Add SmallPDF<br> sample PDF and unit test    * Pass horizontal fontF<br>actor to decodeText()    Pass the fontFactor value (<br>font size multiplied by the text-matrix scale value)<br> to decodeText() so it can more accurately separate <br>text into words by position. A font factor divided b<br>y four seems to give the best results for both horiz<br>ontal and vertical positioning, although this value <br>is selected arbitrarily.    In Font::decodeText() so<br>me PDFs may have text-matrix scale values so large t<br>hat directly encoded horizontal tabs are used in pla<br>ce of spaces. Remove internal tabs from texts and re<br>place them with plain spaces.    * Update PDFObject.<br>php    Restore the $offset parameter to public funct<br>ion getCommandsText() for backwards compatibility.  <br>  * moved new PDFs into special folder    adapted pa<br>ths in tests    * split DocumentTest class    spit i<br>nto a general one, one that is issue related and  on<br>e which is PDF generator related    * added 3 PDFs g<br>enerated by different generators + tests    * More a<br>ccounting for horizontal font factor    Account for <br>the entire font-factor (font-size multiplied by the <br>horizontal scaling factor of the text-matrix) when e<br>stimating the width of the current text block.    In<br>sert a fix when decoding octal strings in Font::deco<br>deOctal(), check further ahead for escaped backslash<br>es.    Remove tests for images in DocumentGeneratorF<br>ocusTest.php. These also fail in the current v2.7.0 <br>release and they should be looked at in a separate P<br>R.    * Revert decodeOctal(), add @internal    Rever<br>t the change to Font::decodeOctal() as it's been sup<br>erceded by PR #640.    Add @internal notes to format<br>Content() and parseDictionary().    * Proper use of <br>PHPDoc "internal"    The @internal tag hides the con<br>tent that comes _after_ it from the documentation, s<br>o adjust these comments as appropriate. See: https:/<br>/manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocu<br>mentor/tutorial_tags.internal.pkg.html    * Disable <br>a failing test    This test will succeed once PR #64<br>0 is merged. It doesn't have anything to do with the<br> current PR, so disable it for now.    * Update PDFO<br>bject.php    Switch to tagging method for @internal.<br> Adjust comments.    * Update PDFObject.php    PHP-C<br>S-Fixer requires spaces between @ statements I guess<br>.    * Return empty array if no valid command detect<br>ed    In some edge cases, the formatContent() method<br> may return a document stream row containing an inva<br>lid command. Make sure we just ignore these commands<br> instead of triggering warnings for missing $matches<br> array elements.    * Update DocumentGeneratorFocusT<br>est.php    Re-enable this assertion, now that we hav<br>e merged #640.    * Make formatContent() private    <br>Make the formatContent() method private to PDFObject<br> so that @internal isn't required. Adjust the unit t<br>ests with ReflectionMethod to account for this.    -<br>--------    Co-authored-by: Konrad Abicht |

It also m<br>inimizes its interaction between user and kernel space processe<br>s during acquisition, which allows it to produce memory capture<br>s that are more forensically sound than those of other tools de<br>signed for Linux memory acquisition. |
